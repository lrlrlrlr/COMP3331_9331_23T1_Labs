    Sample code for Receiver
    Python 3
    Usage: python3 receiver.py receiver_port sender_port FileReceived.txt flp rlp
    coding: utf-8

    Notes:
        Try to run the server first with the command:
            python3 receiver_template.py 9000 10000 FileReceived.txt 1 1
        Then run the sender:
            python3 sender_template.py 10000 9000 FileToReceived.txt 1000 1
